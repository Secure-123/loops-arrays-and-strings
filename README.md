#Loops, Arrays and Strings

1. Open *basic_concepts.php*. Answer the questions in comments in this file. 
2. Have a look at *band_form.html* and *display_bands.php*. When the user enters selects a genre and submits the form, the details for all the bands that match the chosen genre should be displayed. You may find it useful to look at array_push (http://php.net/manual/en/function.array-push.php) as a way of storing bands that match the chosen genre.
3. Add a text box to the form so that the user can enter a search term for location of the band as well as selecting the genre e.g. a user might enter 'New York' and select 'hip-hop', the search results should then present 'The Wu-Tang Clan'. Have a look at using the strpos() (http://php.net/manual/en/function.strpos.php) function to help you search.
